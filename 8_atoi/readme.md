# String to Integer (atoi)

This is a "norminette-like" approach to leetcode's atoi.

The leetcode's atoi tests test extreme cases, even extrapolating the long long unsigned int reach.
The code, therefore, needs to be prepared to meet the conditions in the description of the project,
as well as the edge tests taken into account.

This version is the most clean i could get by now.
