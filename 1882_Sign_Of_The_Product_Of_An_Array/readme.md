### Programming Skills Study Plan

## Intuition
The challenge descriptions cites the use of a helper function to be returned. Getting the program done was a first or second try, the real issue was how to optimize it to the max level possible.

## Final Strategy
I reduced the code to the bare minimum required to output the expected values. I cutted the helper function cited, did a for loop with a size_t variable, checked first for 0s..

## Things to improve
Still, i couldn't get the best memory allocation performance. I ended up beating around 70% of the submissions. So maybe i have to do a little digging about how can i make this function even shorter/lighter. In terms of execution speed, it's at the top.
