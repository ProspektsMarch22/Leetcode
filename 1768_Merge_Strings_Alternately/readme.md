# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

### Programming Skills Study Plan

This is the first challenge in the "Basic Implementation" section of the "Programming Skills" LeetCode Study Plan.

## Intuition

The main challenge was to deal with the different sized inputs. Since the merged string could have varied sizes, i'd have to create a malloc statement to deal with the creation and return of a string. 

Other approach could be if i took one of the strings, preferably the longest one, and realloc space in it. I reckon it would not be worth a shot.

## Conclusion

The implementation is pretty much straight, inspecting the code makes the understanding clear.
